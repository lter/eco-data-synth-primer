## Overview

This page houses the beginnings of our 'how to edit the website' instructions. Note that this page is <u>primarily for internal use</u> so it assumes you already are a member of the group and have the necessary access to the source GitHub repository.

## Editing the Website

There are a few viable options for contributing to this website. Choose the method that aligns best with your skills and/or the one that sparks the most joy for you.

### Method 1: Through GitHub

We've done some fancy behind-the-scenes wrangling with GitHub to support this method (see [here](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#publish-command) if that is of interest) but the key take-away is that edits made directly in GitHub should "just work."

Here's what you'll need to do beforehand:

1. Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
2. Make sure you have access to [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/lter/eco-data-synth-primer) where the materials live




### Method 2: Through RStudio

If you're more confident with a Git-based workflow, you can use RStudio (or any comparable platform) to make edits to the website.



### Method 3: Through Collaborators

If you'd prefer, you can write the text that you'd like to include in a standard text editor software (e.g, Microsoft Word, Google Docs, etc.). Once you've written it there, send it to someone else on the team who can use one of the preceding methods to get that content integrated. Ideally, hosting through GitHub (and creating this document) empowers you to make edits on your own behalf but if that feels out of reach in this moment **we absolutely still want your insight** so please don't hesitate to go this direction if necessary.
