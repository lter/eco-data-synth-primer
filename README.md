# Ecological Data Synthesis: A Primer on Essential Methods

Materials for a short course that will be presented for the first time at ESA 2024. The materials are meant to serve as a living [website](https://lter.github.io/eco-data-synth-primer/) so that we can revisit and improve the materials over time.
