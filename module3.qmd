# Learning objectives


- **Understand** data publishing best-practices and the features that make data easy to re-use
- **Evaluate** the metadata and fitness-for-use of published synthesis datasets
- **Understand** the three primary "products" that come out of synthesis groups
- **Understand** concepts of data provenance, reproducible analysis, and citations
- **Evaluate** the reproducibility of a recent data synthesis project
- **Understand** the different models of data accessibility, licensing, and authorship practices and **apply** them to a synthesis groupâ€™s desired outcomes
- **Understand** several funding opportunities that for synthesis research, their requirements and expectations, and their respective strengths and weaknesses for starting and sustaining synthesis research.
- **Create** a plan to maintain a synthesis project and associated data over the long-term


# Publishing data for re-use

**Estimated time: 12 min**

Harmonized data that are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) are an important output for any ecological data synthesis project. Two key questions that should be considered during the data publishing phase are:

    a. How should the data be structured or formatted?
    b. What metadata are needed to describe the data?
    
Both questions should be answered in such a way that the usability of the data is maximized. 

## Synthesis data structures and formats

Data structure refers to the arrangement and organization of individual units of information in a data file. Data format generally refers to the data file type, i.e. text files, Microsoft Excel files, .jpeg image files, etc. Some data files are both a format and a structure. For example, comma separated value, or CSV, files are a common text-based data files where each line of text represents a table row, and data in columns are separated by commas.

* Database
* Text tables
* Special data types

## Metadata

Metadata are data about the data. As a general rule, metadata should describe

  * **Who** collected the data
  * **What** was observed or measured
  * **When** the data were collected
  * **Where** the data were collected
  * **How** the data were collected (methods, instruments, etc.)

Oftentimes, including information about **why** the data were collected can help future users understand the context of the data and use them.

**Assembling metadata should begin early**, and is an integral part of doing data synthesis throughout the life-cycle of the project. Consider building metadata collection in to the workflow and project management elements of your project.

## Activity: Evaluate published datasets

**Estimated time: 10 min**

Form breakout groups and course instructors will assign each group a dataset (a DOI) for evaluation. With your group, answer these questions about the dataset:

1. Where were the data collected?
2. What variables were measured and in what units?
3. Are the data raw or have they been altered since collection? If the latter, how?
4. Were the first three questions easy to answer? Why or why not?

# Connecting the elements of a synthesis project

**Estimated time: 25 min**

There are three interconnected elements to a synthesis project (or any research project, really): the data, 
the analytical workflow, and the results. Each of these elements is a valuable product of synthesis science,
and each should reference the others.

## Publishing data (5)

* Data and metadata
* Data provenance - especially important in synthesis
* Research data repositories
* Licensing, etc.

## Sharing the workflow (7)

* Data sources
* Code for analysis
* Version control systems
* Future contributions

## Writing the results (3)

* Most often this means writing a paper
  - Citing data in a paper
  - Presenting a reproducible workflow
* Other products may be apps, teaching modules, etc.
  - MacrosystemsEDDIE as an example?
  - Shiny apps
 
## Tying these all together (5)


## Giving everyone credit (5)

## Activity: Evaluate three synthesis projects

**Estimated time: 12 min**

Form breakout groups and course instructors will assign each group a synthesis project, with links to one or more
elements (the code, a paper, a dataset, etc.). Try to put together the rest of the picture (other publications, 
source/derived data, etc.). Then, answer these questions:

1. Who was involved in the synthesis project?
2. How many journal articles and datasets were published?
3. Could you reproduce results or contribute new data to the project based on what you found?
4. What elements are missing or difficult to understand?
