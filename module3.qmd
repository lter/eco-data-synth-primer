- **Identify** the features that make published data easily
re-useable
- **Evaluate** the metadata and fitness-for-use of published synthesis datasets
- **Understand** the three primary "products" that come out of synthesis groups
- **Understand** concepts of data provenance, reproducible analysis, and citations
- **Evaluate** the reproducibility of a recent data synthesis project

- **Understand** several funding opportunities that for synthesis research, their requirements and expectations, and their respective strengths and weaknesses for starting and sustaining synthesis research.
- **Create** a plan to maintain a synthesis project and associated data over the long-term

# Introduction

So far, we've made the point that ecological synthesis research is collaborative and integrates a wide range of data. Synthesis research is also intended to be **influential** and **useful**. There are many definitions of "influential and useful" to consider here, but successful synthesis research tends to expand the boundaries of knowledge and aims to improve human lives or the environment. The ability of synthesis research accomplish this frequently depends on what knowledge or products are created, and how the synthesis team disseminates and communicates them to the outside world.

# Publishing data for re-use

**Estimated time: 12 min**

In Module 2 we discussed some considerations for creating and formatting a harmonized dataset useful for synthesis research. We also introduced the importance of metadata for making data usable. Harmonized data that are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) are an important output for almost any ecological synthesis project.

## More about Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR) data

The FAIR principles, standing for Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability,  are a community-standard set of guidelines for evaluating the quality and utility of published research data. Making an effort to meet the critera outlined in the FAIR principles promotes both human and machine usability of data, and is a worthy objective when preparing to publish the data products from a synthesis research project.

The FAIR principles were first defined in the paper by Wilkinson et al (2018)[^1]. Since this time, many resources have arisen to guide the implementation the FAIR principles[^2][^3], and to quantify FAIR data successes and failures in the research and publishing communities[^4][^5].

    b. What metadata are needed to describe the data?
    
Both questions should be answered in such a way that the usability of the data is maximized. 

## Synthesis data structures and formats

Data structure refers to the arrangement and organization of individual units of information in a data file. Data format generally refers to the data file type, i.e. text files, Microsoft Excel files, .jpeg image files, etc. Some data files are both a format and a structure. For example, comma separated value, or CSV, files are a common text-based data files where each line of text represents a table row, and data in columns are separated by commas.

* Database
* Text tables
* Special data types

## Metadata

Metadata are data about the data. As a general rule, metadata should describe

  * **Who** collected the data
  * **What** was observed or measured
  * **When** the data were collected
  * **Where** the data were collected
  * **How** the data were collected (methods, instruments, etc.)

Oftentimes, including information about **why** the data were collected can help future users understand the context of the data and use them.

**Assembling metadata should begin early**, and is an integral part of doing data synthesis throughout the life-cycle of the project. Consider building metadata collection in to the workflow and project management elements of your project.

## Activity: Evaluate published datasets

**Estimated time: 10 min**

Form breakout groups and course instructors will assign each group a dataset (a DOI) for evaluation. With your group, answer these questions about the dataset:

1. Where were the data collected?
2. What variables were measured and in what units?
3. Are the data raw or have they been altered since collection? If the latter, how?
4. Were the first three questions easy to answer? Why or why not?

# Connecting the elements of a synthesis project

**Estimated time: 25 min**

There are three interconnected elements to a synthesis project (or any research project, really): the data, 
the analytical workflow, and the results. Each of these elements is a valuable product of synthesis science,
and each should reference the others.

</p>


## Publishing data (5)

* Data and metadata
* Data provenance - especially important in synthesis
* Research data repositories
* Licensing, etc.

## Sharing the workflow (7)

* Data sources
* Code for analysis
* Version control systems
* Future contributions

## Writing the results (3)

* Most often this means writing a paper
  - Citing data in a paper
  - Presenting a reproducible workflow
* Data papers
  - Anatomy of a data paper?
* Other products may be apps, teaching modules, etc.
  - MacrosystemsEDDIE as an example?
  - Shiny apps
 
## Tying these all together (5)

Some general considerations

* Synthesis projects can become complex

## Giving everyone credit (5)

## Activity: Evaluate three synthesis projects

**Estimated time: 12 min**

Form breakout groups and course instructors will assign each group a synthesis project, with links to one or more
elements (the code, a paper, a dataset, etc.). Try to put together the rest of the picture (other publications, 
source/derived data, etc.). Then, answer these questions:

1. Who was involved in the synthesis project?
2. How many journal articles and datasets were published?
3. Could you reproduce results or contribute new data to the project based on what you found?
4. What elements are missing or difficult to understand?
