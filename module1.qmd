# Define Synthesis
For the purposes of today's discussion, we define synthesis as:
>bringing together the results of multiple studies to test novel hypotheses–usually with a team of people.

Here are a few of the key activities for beginning synthesis research:

* **Assembling a diverse and inclusive team**
* **Asking scientific questions**, often with a broad scope or at large spatial scales
* **Finding information** (or data) from a wide variety of sources to answer those questions
* ...

# Motivating Synthesis

This process--of bringing diverse expertise together to combine existing primary data--definitely has its challenges. Ideniftying and engaging the necessary combination of skills and experience is challenging. Scheduling meeting times can be difficult. Commitment to the process can be uneven. Nonetheless, virtually all who have experienced it find it to be a deeply rewarding experience. Why?


-  The products emerging from synthesis typically have higher impact (as defined by both academic and applied measures)
-  The process allows researchers to access and incorporate skills that they don't (yet) have themselves.
-  Working groups help early career researchers build their science networks. 
-  Keep experienced researchers fresh and engaging with new ideas
-  Builds on existing investments of the science community by re-using data
-  Offers a way to involve individuals who can’t or don’t want to do fieldwork in original research and expands opportunity to less research-intensive institutions.
