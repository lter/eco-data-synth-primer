## Define Synthesis
For the purposes of today's discussion, we define synthesis as:

> Synthesis is: bringing together the results of multiple studies to test novel hypotheses–usually with a team of people.

## Why Synthesis?

<img style="float: right;" src="images/sustainability-12-09361-g001-550.jpg" alt="different levels of interaction between researchers and stakeholders" width="50%" padding="10px"/>
This process--of bringing diverse expertise together to combine existing primary data--definitely has its challenges. Ideniftying and engaging the necessary combination of skills and experience is challenging. Scheduling meeting times can be difficult. Commitment to the process can be uneven. Nonetheless, virtually all who have experienced it find it to be a deeply rewarding experience. Why?

-  The products emerging from synthesis typically have higher impact (as defined by both academic and applied measures)
-  The process allows researchers to access and incorporate skills that they don't (yet) have themselves.
-  Working groups help early career researchers build their science networks. 
-  Keep experienced researchers fresh and engaging with new ideas
-  Builds on existing investments of the science community by re-using data
-  Offers a way to involve individuals who can’t or don’t want to do fieldwork in original research and expands opportunity to less research-intensive institutions.

## Typical Process

Typically, a group of researchers--or researchers and managers or community members--will plan a series of meetings over 2-3 years. The mix of in-person v. virtual meetings and work will vary across different groups and different funders, but the general pattern is similar.

Early meetings focus on narrowing the questions and deciding what data is needed and what analyses will be most useful. A period of data gathering and assembly comes next. The assembly of data almost always prompts a revision of the initial questions, as data rarely comes in exactly the form that researchers expected. This can be both the most frustrating and the most interesting part of the process as new hypotheses and models are floated and discussed. It is especially important to have the full participation of researchers familiar with different fields and ecosystems in this process.

With tractable questions refined, the group will move into analysis mode. Often, a few individuals will do most of the data wrangling and coding, but will need continuous input on analytical decisions. In our experience, GitHub issues is one very good tool for facilitating and recording these decisions. But the "best" tool will be the one that most members of the team are most comfortable with.

Later meetings will focus on developing manuscripts and/or application-related products such as white papers and decision support tools.

## How to get Involved

Often, early career researchers will be excited about the idea of synthesis but be unsure how to connect with existing or nascent synthesis efforts. Here are a few ideas for how to make yourself available and valuable to synthesis groups.:

-  Make it known you want to be involved in synthesis
    -  Let your advisor know
    -  Share your enthusiasm
-  Skill building: 
    -  Synthesis Skills for Early Career Researchers: SSECR
    -  Data Carpentries
    -  ESIIL: innovation summit, hackathons
    -  Environmental Data Science Summit
-  Build your community
    -  Ask questions at meetings
    -  Initiate conversations
-  *Start your own!*

# Identifying a Question

Lots of questions are interesting, but not terribly well-suited for a synthesis approach. We've learned through hard personal experience taht there are a few qualities that make certain questions a better fit for a) combining data and b) work by a group. The primary qualities that we've learned to seek in synthesis projects include:

-  Novel and interesting enough to spend 2-3 years deeply involved
-  Data already exists and you know (at least generally) where to find it
-  The question covers a large geographic area or data that aren’t normally collected/analyzed together
-  Clearly framed, but flexible enough to allow adaptation through the process
-  Responsive to the funding call
-  Outputs could include several kinds of products:
    -  Papers of various kinds,
    -  Symposia, 
    -  Datasets, 
    -  Analytical packages
