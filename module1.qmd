## Define Synthesis
For the purposes of today's discussion, we define synthesis as:

> Synthesis is: bringing together the results of multiple studies to test novel hypotheses–usually with a team of people.

## Why Synthesis?

<img style="float: right;" src="images/sustainability-12-09361-g001-550.jpg" alt="different levels of interaction between researchers and stakeholders" width="50%" padding="10px"/>
This process--of bringing diverse expertise together to combine existing primary data--definitely has its challenges. Ideniftying and engaging the necessary combination of skills and experience is challenging. Scheduling meeting times can be difficult. Commitment to the process can be uneven. Nonetheless, virtually all who have experienced it find it to be a deeply rewarding experience. Why?

-  The products emerging from synthesis typically have higher impact (as defined by both academic and applied measures)
-  The process allows researchers to access and incorporate skills that they don't (yet) have themselves.
-  Working groups help early career researchers build their science networks. 
-  Keep experienced researchers fresh and engaging with new ideas
-  Builds on existing investments of the science community by re-using data
-  Offers a way to involve individuals who can’t or don’t want to do fieldwork in original research and expands opportunity to less research-intensive institutions.

# Process Overview

While it is certainly possible to conduct synthesis with no external support, a bit of funding will allow your group to travel to meet up in person and can, in some cases, provide salary support for postdocs, grad students or or assistance with analysis.

## Typical Process

Typically, a group of researchers--or researchers and managers or community members--will plan a series of meetings over 2-3 years. The mix of in-person v. virtual meetings and work will vary across different groups and different funders, but the general pattern is similar.

Early meetings focus on narrowing the questions and deciding what data is needed and what analyses will be most useful. A period of data gathering and assembly comes next. The assembly of data almost always prompts a revision of the initial questions, as data rarely comes in exactly the form that researchers expected. This can be both the most frustrating and the most interesting part of the process as new hypotheses and models are floated and discussed. It is especially important to have the full participation of researchers familiar with different fields and ecosystems in this process.

With tractable questions refined, the group will move into analysis mode. Often, a few individuals will do most of the data wrangling and coding, but will need continuous input on analytical decisions. In our experience, GitHub issues is one very good tool for facilitating and recording these decisions. But the "best" tool will be the one that most members of the team are most comfortable with.

Later meetings will focus on developing manuscripts and/or application-related products such as white papers and decision support tools.

## How to get Involved

Often, early career researchers will be excited about the idea of synthesis but be unsure how to connect with existing or nascent synthesis efforts. Here are a few ideas for how to make yourself available and valuable to synthesis groups.:

-  Make it known you want to be involved in synthesis
    -  Let your advisor know
    -  Share your enthusiasm
-  Skill building: 
    -  Synthesis Skills for Early Career Researchers: SSECR
    -  Data Carpentries
    -  ESIIL: innovation summit, hackathons
    -  Environmental Data Science Summit
-  Build your community
    -  Ask questions at meetings
    -  Initiate conversations
-  *Start your own!*

# Identifying a Question

Lots of questions are interesting, but not terribly well-suited for a synthesis approach. We've learned through experience that there are a few qualities that make some questions a better fit for a) combining data; and b) work by a group. The main qualities that we seek in synthesis projects include:

-  Novel and interesting enough to be involved with for 2-3 years.
-  Data already exist and you know (at least generally) where to find it
-  Questions cover a large geographic area or data that aren’t normally collected or analyzed together
-  Clearly framed, but flexible enough to allow adaptation through the process
-  Responsive to the funding call
-  Outputs could include several kinds of products:
    -  Papers (including data papers, persepctives, gap analyses, as well as primary analyses)
    -  Symposia 
    -  Datasets 
    -  Analytical Packages

## Data Use Principles

There are a few ethical and practical guidelines that will save you a lot of trouble if you can adhere to them from the start of a project.
-  Keep track of your data sources (sources, permissions, notes, related metadata, what’s included)
-  Data sources should always be cited
-  Communicate with data creators whenever possible 
    -  This doesn't need to be onerous and it can uncover issues and opportunities associated with data sources. 

> **Sample data author outreach email for public dataset:** 
Dear Dr. Smith, 
I am working on a synthesis of soil inverbrate diversity across North America and would like to include your dataset titled "xxx" (doi: xxx). We have downloaded the data from yyy repository, but wanted to let you know we are using it and to inquire whether there is any additional context we should be aware of or related datasets we should be sure to include. A short description of the synthesis project follows. Please let me know by xxx date if you have any questions or concerns with our use of this data.
Thank you,

> **Sample data author outreach email for unpublished dataset:** 
Dear Dr. Smith, 
I am working on a synthesis of soil inverbrate diversity across North America and would like to include the dataset behind your paper titled {xxx} (doi:{yyy}), which seems highly relevant. Would it be possible to obtain the data? Ideally, we would access it through through a public repository, such as the [Environmental Data Initiative](https://edirepository.org/), which offers assistance in curation and submission of datasets. Either way, we would credit you as the data originator and want you know we are using it. If there is any additional context we should be aware of or related datasets we should be sure to include, please let us know. A short description of the synthesis project follows. 
Thank you,

# **Authorship Discussion**

> **Should all data contributors be offerred authorship? How would you deal with a data creator who demanded authorship in order to use their data?**

# **A Few Considerations**

Having agreed-on authorship guidelines is really valuable in this situation. Are they really committed enough to join the working group and contribute to the papers? If so, it may be a good investment.

How much work will they need to put in to make the data ready?

How critical is this particular data source for your analysis?

You will need to make your derived dataset public. Are they placing conditions on the use of their data that make that impossible?
